## Last Week's Accomplishments

> We had some major group meetings to discuss tasks for this semester at the front-end side. We set up goals and decided to first focus on some small optimization, and later move on to major improvements. The main goal for the upcoming week is to change the display of shuttle arrival schedule forms. Basically, we hope to make display of arrival time more user-friendly and more simplified.

## This Week's Plan

> We plan to first get familiarized with HTML and CSS in order to understand the current code, and then we can start some modifications. We will follow our plan now and keep going on.

## Anything Blocking?

> The main obstacle now is to understand the current code structures for the front-end design, but we will be sure to get over it as soon as we learn more on related languages.

## Notes

> No
