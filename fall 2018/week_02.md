## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Got a further in-depth look at which specific working group I should join this semester, and the conclusion was probably the frond-end group or notifications. Though I initially hoped to join the iOS App design group. However, lacking of an Mac OS operating system kind of prevented me from doing that this semester. My initial goal is to learn more at whatever aspect, so I'll just stick with front-end or notifications.

## This Week's Plan

> After settle down with a specific group, I'm going to first try to learn everything I need to work with the group and start making some contributions probably.

## Anything Blocking?

> Currently no. I had a busy last week with several exams and assignments to cope with. Time (schedule) is currently the biggest problem.

## Notes

> No
