## Last Week's Accomplishments

## This Week's Plan

> I'm going to focus on enhancing better UI design for our new schedule inquiry page, and I'm also going to aid my teammates to design this inquiry system. We are also going to give the presentation this Friday. 

## Anything Blocking?

> We are trying to figure out a way to connect our work with the Scheduling group, but we should be fine very soon.

## Notes
