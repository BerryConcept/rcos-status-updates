## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I had made contact with people who are in charge of shuttle scheduling in the parking and transportation office on campus, and I successfully finished the json data file for the Monday-Thursday East Route schedule, based on the program I wrote for better shuttle schedule database implementation in python.

## This Week's Plan

> Keep coorperating with the manager from the parking office on campus to further confirm our schedule times are correct and accurate. Get started with Monday-Thursday West schedule json data file and Weekend Late night schedule data file

## Anything Blocking?

> I need to get an eletronic copy of Friday shuttle schedule for both East and West route. I could not find them anywhere on school websites for now, but I've already reported this issue to the manager of the parking office and hopefully they will have them next week.

## Notes
