## Last Week's Accomplishments

> We started to clear some tasks brought from last semester, and our front-end design group reformed with new recruits and integrated tasks with some leftover back-end group problems. We drew the temporary plan about what we are going to do throughout the semester.

## This Week's Plan

> My friend and I are going to clear out tasks first we left unfinished last semester before moving on to new problems. I need to now finish verifying schedule time data with related authorities on campus and ensure we have valid "scheduled arrival time" data before I can construct our json back-end database for our schedule filter.

## Anything Blocking?

> We need to get in touch with people who used to design and maintain the front-end design, and figure out more about the underlying structure of front-end webpage so we can start working on it. 

## Notes
