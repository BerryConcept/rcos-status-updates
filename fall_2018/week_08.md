## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I did not do too much practical works relating the Shuttle Tracker since it was getting close to the Thanksgiving holiday. We indeed divided our works for further tasks and I planned to optimize the interface for our scheduling filter.

## This Week's Plan

> I will make front-end optimization for our scheduling filter web page and make the filter more intuitive and convenient to use. I'll try to adjust the UI and to make it looks better.

## Anything Blocking?

> Not really. Since the task for now is to help out our group finish up the filtering design and optimizations.

## Notes

> No
