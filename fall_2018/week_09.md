## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Upon the end of this semester, I kept working on the general layout part of our scheduling filter web page. I also helped our front-end group get data smoothly from the back-end schedule group, which in a way verified the standard of how we were going to transform our data and display it to our web page.

## This Week's Plan

> Since there are not too much time left before the end of this semester, I'll try to finish up my works with the layout designs and make our scheduling filter usable. I'll also make sure our data transformation works fine between our group and the scheduling group.

## Anything Blocking?

> Currently I have no problem, but we may encouter some issues when handling data into our filters. 

## Notes

> No
