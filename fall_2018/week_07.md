## Last Week's Accomplishments

> We achieved agreements on the design of front-end web interface, typically the detailed design for optimizing our scheduling search part. We moved on to concentrate our work on instantiating multi-dimension searching features.

## This Week's Plan

> We are going to keep focusing on optimizing our scheduling search feature and also connecting with scheduling group to grab our data from the back-end side.

## Anything Blocking?

> Currently no. Maybe still something about time management, since things are going to wrap up to the final.

## Notes

> No
