## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I did not do too much work on improving the code for scheduling last week due to my heavy workload. I did think of ways we can provide more intuitive and practical features for our schedule filter web page.

## This Week's Plan

## Anything Blocking?

> Still, time management is the most serious obstacle that I need to handle every week. 

## Notes
