## Last Week's Accomplishments

> We completed a demo html scheduling filter for the presentation, and we presented our progress on Friday's big group meeting. We also have contacted with other groups in the Shuttle Tracker to resolve tasks conflicts.

## This Week's Plan

> We are going to continue working on the scheduling filters and hope to add this feature to the master very soon. In terms of design, we will try to enhance the friendly UI further and provide more filter functionalities.

## Anything Blocking?

> Probably time management is kind of critical considering the second mid-term exams are coming soon.

## Notes

> No
